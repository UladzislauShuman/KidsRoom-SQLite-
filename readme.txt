about program:
in one day i wanted to learn smth new and my eyes fell on SQL
after a guids about language SQL, i wanted to use it somewhere
and remembered, that in university i had made one small project on C++, where i cound use database
and i used it.

if you want to run it:
you should dowland sqlite3-library from 
official site

program possibilities:
- Add new Toy
- Drop toy from database
- Select toys 

for now the main problams are:
- dont use ToysRoom
- in every h-file you can find unnecessary
includes
- may be not quite effective
